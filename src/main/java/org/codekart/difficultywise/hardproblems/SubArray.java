      * You are given a 0-indexed array of integers nums of length n, and two
      * positive integers k and dist.
      * 
      * The cost of an array is the value of its first element. For example, the cost
      * of [1,2,3] is 1 while the cost of [3,4,1] is 3.
      * 
      * You need to divide nums into k disjoint contiguous subarrays, such that the
      * difference between the starting index of the second subarray and the starting
      * index of the kth subarray should be less than or equal to dist. In other
      * words, if you divide nums into the subarrays nums[0..(i1 - 1)], nums[i1..(i2
      * - 1)], ..., nums[ik-1..(n - 1)], then ik-1 - i1 <= dist.
      * 
      * Return the minimum possible sum of the cost of these subarrays.
